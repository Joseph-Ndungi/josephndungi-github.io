## Innova Fitness Squad: Ragia Forest & Falls Hike

The Ragia Forest, a green and beautiful place in the big Aberdare National Park area, is more than just a hiking trail. It's a spot with a lot of history and amazing nature. This thick, almost magical forest was a safe place and a strong base for **Mau Mau freedom fighters**, like important people such as **Dedan Kimathi**, when Kenya fought for its freedom (1952-1960). Its rough land and thick trees gave them perfect cover. This made it a very important battleground in our country's history. Besides its past, Ragia is crucial for water. It feeds rivers that give water to Nairobi, including the **Sasumua Dam**. It's also home to many different plants and animals, though seeing big animals on the main trails is quite rare. Recently, I went on an 18-kilometer walk into this amazing place with Outdoorer KE, and it was a trip I'll never forget.

### Starting Early with Outdoorer KE: The Race to Ragia

"Well, this hike was easier than some I've done before," I thought as we walked. Some in the group found the hills tough, but for me, it was a nice, easy walk. The weather wasn't super sunny, but it wasn't bad either – just a soft, mild feeling from the forest. The only surprise was a sudden heavy rain that hit us just as we were finishing!

My trip began very early in Nairobi, around 5:50 AM. I met some friends at my pickup spot and car pooled to Ola Gitaru, feeling excited even though it was so early. We got there before our minivan, which was good because Outdoorer KE had sent some funny, but firm, messages the night before. They warned us that if we weren't there by 6:15 AM sharp, they'd have "barely no time to wait." A small problem with our Uber could have messed things up, but we made it right on time!

While we waited for the rest of the group, we grabbed some much-needed coffee. The smell mixed with the fresh morning air. Once everyone was there, the bus felt alive with excitement. We said quick hellos and easily picked our travel friends for the over 70-kilometer ride ahead. For the first 40 kilometers or so, my spacebuds were on, and I quickly fell asleep, catching up on rest, while the rest of the bus was loud with chatting and jokes.

A planned bathroom stop halfway through the ride turned into a fun social time. Some of us, feeling adventurous, decided to have some drinks before the hike. A few people looked surprised at the idea of whiskey shots before a long walk, but I can tell you now, it was the **best decision**. The shared sips and the warm feeling of the whiskey instantly got rid of any morning tiredness, making everyone more relaxed and sparking really interesting stories. The bus became a place of laughter and good feelings, setting the perfect mood for the day.

### Deep into Ragia Forest: Mau Mau Echoes and Elephant Paths

When we got to the start of the trail, you could feel the energy. We stretched a bit with some warm-up exercises, getting our bodies ready for the adventure. A few of us quickly ate breakfast to make sure we had enough energy for the 18-kilometer walk – 9 kilometers to the amazing falls and 9 kilometers back. The air here felt different right away, cooler and smelling of the forest earth. The **bushy Ragia Forest** truly wrapped around us; it really felt calming, a welcome break from the busy city.

To keep us safe, especially from the many elephants living there (though we were lucky not to see any this time), we had an armed KWS (Kenya Wildlife Service) ranger with us. His presence, a quiet reminder of the wildness around us, helped us relax and fully enjoy the beautiful nature. The path, even with its gentle ups and downs, felt easy for me, as I've done many hikes before. The weather, with soft light coming through the trees, made the forest feel even more special.

The 9-kilometer walk to the falls was full of amazing sights. Every turn showed off **beautiful views**, making us stop often for photos. The group naturally spread out – some wanted to walk fast, others preferred a slower pace, taking in every detail. True to the Outdoorer KE spirit, the faster groups patiently waited for the others to catch up, showing how we all supported each other.

Our KWS guide wasn't just there for safety; he was also a great storyteller. As we walked, he shared fascinating, often dramatic, tales of the **Mau Mau fight for freedom** that happened right in these woods. While I knew some of these stories, passed down over time, might have been a bit stretched – our guide even admitted it with a smile, saying he had "stories *za jaba*" (exaggerated tales) – they added an incredible layer of history to our hike. Walking where freedom fighters once hid, hearing whispers of their brave acts, made the forest feel alive with its past.

### The Amazing Ragia Falls: A Freezing Swim and Rushing Water

After about 9 kilometers of walking through the green forest, the clear sound of rushing water grew louder, telling us we were getting close to the amazing **Ragia Falls**. The sight that met us was truly stunning – water powerfully falling into a clean pool, surrounded by green trees. It was a raw, strong display of nature's power. Cameras clicked constantly, trying to capture its beauty.

Then came the exciting part for the brave ones. The water, fed by streams from the high Aberdare mountains, was **ice cold** – almost shockingly so! But the urge was too strong. I, along with several others, jumped right in, fully clothed, loving the thrilling shock. It was a really refreshing dip after the long walk. Luckily, I had planned ahead and brought a change of clothes, which I was very thankful for as I shivered out of the wild water. After a good, memorable time by the falls, enjoying the beauty and the thrill of the cold swim, we started our walk back.

### The Walk Back: Smart Kids and a Race Against the Rain

The walk back was just as fun. I found myself walking with a bright, young kid, and we had a great talk, sharing stories and laughs. I really like smart kids; they always have fresh ideas. Luckily, he was also a cyclist, so we bonded over our shared passion for two wheels and just shared good vibes all the way. We were among the first group to make good time, walking at a quick but comfortable speed.

As we got closer to the bus, the sky started to look dark and threatening. Big, heavy clouds began to gather, signaling that rain was coming. We quickly sped up, determined to beat the rain. We were literally just a few steps from the bus when it started pouring! It was a very heavy rain. Those who were slower, the "niggas at the back" as we jokingly called them, got completely soaked. They arrived at the bus dripping wet from head to toe. Meanwhile, we, who got there first, were already comfortably changed into dry clothes, resting and talking about the day's adventures.

It was an incredible experience, from the early start to the refreshing (and cold!) jump in the falls, and even the final sprint to escape the rain. I loved every single bit of it, a truly unforgettable trip with Outdoorer KE.
