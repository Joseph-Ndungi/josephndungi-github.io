# Advance Exception Handling

Writing dependable and sturdy code is essential to ensuring that your programs handle unexpected mistakes gracefully and avoid crashes. This is where exception handling comes in. We'll delve deeply into the realm of exceptions in this tutorial, covering the many kinds of exceptions, their raising and handling, and the best approaches for managing errors in Python.

Exceptions are disruptions in the standard operation of a program, triggered by various issues including incorrect data entry, file handling errors, or other unforeseen problems during runtime.

When such exceptions occur, they interrupt the regular execution of the program. In the absence of exception handling mechanisms, Python programs would terminate abruptly upon facing any error. However, using tools such as the try-except block allows us to manage these exceptions effectively and respond accordingly.

## Common Types of Exceptions in Python

Python has a wide range of built-in exception classes for different types of errors:

ImportError – Raised when a module/library cannot be imported
IndexError – Occurs when trying to access an invalid index in a list, tuple, etc
NameError – Happens when using an undeclared variable
TypeError – Indicates two incompatible types are mixed in an operation
ValueError – Occurs when built-in functions receive inappropriate arguments
ZeroDivisionError – Thrown when dividing by zero
FileNotFoundError – Raised when a file cannot be found at a specified path
KeyboardInterruption – Called on pressing Ctrl+C keys
SyntaxError: Raised for syntax errors.
