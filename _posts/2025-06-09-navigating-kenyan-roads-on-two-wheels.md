### **Answering the Big Question: Is It Safe to Cycle on Kenyan Roads?**

The other day, as I proudly showed off my new bicycle, a friend looked at me with the kind of genuine concern, leaned in and asked the question that’s on every aspiring Kenyan cyclist's mind: *“Lakini, is it even safe to cycle on our roads?”*

It’s a fair question. Let’s be honest: Kenyan roads are a special kind of ecosystem. It’s a concrete jungle where matatus frequently challenge the laws of physics, boda bodas materialize out of thin air, and some potholes have their own postal codes. The idea of navigating this beautiful chaos on a metal frame with two skinny wheels can seem, well, insane.

And yet, my answer, after a few hundred kilometres clocked and a thick layer of dust permanently attached to my soul, is a cautious but resounding **YES**.

It can be safe. It can be incredibly rewarding. It can be the best thing you do for your body and mind. But it’s not about luck. It's about being smart, being prepared, and being more visible than a traffic police officer on a Friday afternoon. Here’s how I learned to stop worrying and love the ride.

### **Section 1: The Golden Rules of Staying Safe**

Think of this as your survival guide. It’s less about having the strongest legs and more about having the sharpest wits.

#### **Be a Human Traffic Light (Be Hyper-Visible)**

Your number one job on the road is to make sure everyone can see you. You need to be impossible to ignore.

* **Dress Loud and Proud:** This is not the time for your cool, all-black aesthetic. Think neon. Hi-vis yellow, fluorescent green, blinding orange. You want to look like a highlighter pen that’s decided to take up a sport.
* **Lights, Camera, Action!:** Lights are not just for the night. A flashing white front light and a red rear light are your best friends, even in the bright midday sun. Modern daytime flashlights are designed to be seen from over a kilometre away. Look for something with at least 100 lumens for the rear and 200+ lumens for the front. They cut through the visual noise and scream “I AM HERE!” to distracted drivers.

#### **Master the "Matatu & Boda Boda Dance"**

This is a delicate art form that requires observation, prediction, and a healthy dose of pessimism.

* **The First Commandment: Assume You Are Invisible.** Seriously. Engrave this on your helmet. Never, ever assume a driver, rider, or pedestrian has seen you. Always ride as if you’re a ghost they can drive right through. This mindset keeps you sharp.
* **Be Boringly Predictable:** Sudden moves are for blockbuster movies, not for your daily commute. Ride in a straight, predictable line. Use clear hand signals *before* you turn or stop. Want to move out to avoid a pothole? Check your shoulder, signal, and then move. No surprises.
* **Claim Your Lane (When Safe):** It feels counterintuitive, but hugging the far edge of the road can be dangerous. It invites drivers to squeeze past you with only inches to spare. Instead, ride about a meter from the curb. This makes you more visible, forces cars to give you a proper berth when overtaking, and gives you an escape route if you need to dodge a sudden obstacle.
* **The Power of the Gaze:** At junctions and roundabouts, try to make eye contact with drivers. A simple nod or glance is often all it takes to confirm they’ve registered your existence. It’s a silent, two-wheeled conversation that can save your skin.

#### **Choose Your Battlefield (Route and Timing)**

You wouldn't learn to swim in the middle of the ocean, so don't learn to cycle on Mombasa Road at 5 PM.

* **Beginner Havens:** Start somewhere peaceful. Explore the quiet roads in residential estates on a Sunday morning. Better yet, head to controlled environments. **Karura Forest** offers beautiful, car-free trails perfect for building confidence. The climb up **Ngong Hills** is tough, but the views and relatively low traffic are worth it.
* **The Magic Hour:** The secret to blissful Kenyan cycling is the time of day. Set your alarm for 5:30 AM. Riding between then and 7:30 AM is a different world. The air is cool and crisp, the sun is rising, and the roads are wonderfully empty. You get your exercise in before the chaos even wakes up.

### **Section 2: Gearing Up (The Tech and The Tin)**

Cycling can look like an expensive hobby, but you can get started without selling a kidney.

* **Your First Trusty Steed:** You do not need a KES 200,000 carbon fibre race bike that weighs less than your lunch. For Kenyan roads, a sturdy **Mountain Bike (MTB)** or a versatile **Hybrid Bike** is your best bet. Their tougher frames and wider tires are perfect for handling our… *character-filled* road surfaces. Good quality second-hand bikes from reputable dealers are a fantastic way to start.
* **The Non-Negotiables:**
  * **A Helmet:** If you have a head, you need a helmet. Full stop. Modern helmets are light, well-ventilated, and some even have tech like MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) for extra safety.
  * **Lights:** Yes, them again. They are that important.
  * **Water Bottle & Cage:** You will sweat. A lot. Hydration is critical.
* **The "My Life is So Much Better Now" Gear:**
  * **Padded Cycling Shorts (Bibs):** Let’s talk about your behind. After 10km on a bike seat, it will start complaining. After 20km, it will file a formal grievance. Padded shorts are the single greatest invention for cycling comfort.
  * **Gloves:** They absorb vibrations, protect your hands if you fall, and improve your grip when things get sweaty.
  * **A Small Pump & Puncture Repair Kit:** Getting a flat tyre is a rite of passage. Learning to fix it on the side of the road makes you feel like a self-sufficient genius.

### **Section 3: The Incredible Rewards (Why We Do This)**

So you’ve dodged the potholes and bought the gear. Why is it all worth it?

#### **The Unwind Button**

As a tech enthusiast, I spend my days staring at screens. Cycling has become my analogue escape, my ultimate unwind button. It’s a space where the only notifications are the changing gears and my own heartbeat. I started tracking my rides on **Strava**, a social network for athletes. At first, it was just to see how far I’d gone. But it quickly became a fascinating data stream of my own progress.

Seeing my average speed increase from 15 km/h to 20 km/h, watching my elevation gain stack up week after week, and conquering a hill that left me breathless a month ago—it's incredibly motivating. It gamifies fitness. If you want to see the stats and follow my journey, you can find me on Strava under the username **Joseph Ndungi**.

#### **Discover a Hidden Kenya**

From a car, you see Kenya. On a bike, you *experience* it. You smell the rain hitting the tarmac in Limuru’s tea fields. You feel the sun on your back as you coast down the hills. You hear the cheerful "Jambo!" from kids in a small village. You discover tiny cafes and viewpoints you’d never notice while stuck in traffic. It’s a sensory overload in the best possible way.

#### **Finding Your Tribe**

The best part? You don't have to do it alone. The cycling community in Kenya is booming, friendly, and diverse. Riding in a group is not only safer but also way more fun. Most groups organize weekly/monthly rides to advocate for cycling in the city, and clubs have rides for all skill levels. The camaraderie of a pre-ride coffee and a post-ride discussion about who conquered which hill segment on Strava is half the fun.

### **Conclusion: Your Invitation to the Road**

So, back to that big question: Is it safe to cycle on Kenyan roads?

The road itself is neutral. It's how you approach it that matters. With the right mindset (assume you're invisible), the right gear (be a traffic light), and the right company, it is not only safe, but it's also one of the most life-affirming, stress-busting, and adventurous hobbies you can pick up in this country.

So, start small. Borrow a bike and ride around Karura this weekend. Look up a beginner group ride. Just start. The road is waiting, and it's more beautiful than you can imagine.

Happy ~~Coding~~ Cycling!
